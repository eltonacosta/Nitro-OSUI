# Nitroctl, a CLI NitroSense alternative for Linux, Made thanks to the linuwu-sense driver.

## What is this?
A tool made with Python that lets you change keyboard RGB colors, thermal profiles, battery limiter and more using the Linuwu-Sense module. Currently, it works on Nitro devices only. Distro-agnostic, does not depend on systemd. Tested on Void Linux and CachyOS.

## Why did I make this?
[Another tool](https://github.com/PXDiv/Div-Acer-Manager-Max) that does the same thing wouldn't work on Void Linux so i decided to make my own, though mine lacks a GUI and is a bit less user friendly.

## Quick install (one-liner)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eltonacosta/nitroctl.git && cd nitroctl && ./setup/install.sh
```

Non-interactive (accepts every prompt — good for scripts and VMs):

```bash
./setup/install.sh --yes
```

CLI only, driver only, or removal:

```bash
./setup/install.sh --no-gui          # terminal interface only
./setup/install.sh --no-driver       # skip the Linuwu-Sense DKMS step
./setup/install.sh --driver-only     # only (re)install the driver via DKMS
./setup/install.sh --uninstall       # remove nitroctl + driver
```

Preview what would happen without changing anything:

```bash
./setup/install.sh --dry-run --verbose
```

Force a specific distro profile (useful in containers or derivatives):

```bash
./setup/install.sh --distro=debian
```

## How the installer works

The installer is profile-driven instead of hardcoded per distro:

1. **Detect** — reads `/etc/os-release` (`ID`, then `ID_LIKE`) and matches a profile in `setup/distros.conf`. Falls back to whichever package manager exists, then to a `generic` profile with manual instructions.
2. **Base** — installs Python, git, the matching kernel headers and, only on Clang-built kernels (like CachyOS), the LLVM toolchain.
3. **App** — clones/updates nitroctl into `~/.local/share/nitroctl` and links `nitroctl` + `nitroctl-gui` into `~/.local/bin`.
4. **GUI** — installs GTK4/Libadwaita bindings from the system packages (no virtualenv, no ~150 MB download).
5. **Driver** — clones Linuwu-Sense, applies the Clang compatibility patch (`strncpy` → `memcpy`, guarded), and registers it with DKMS, so kernel updates rebuild the module automatically.

Dialogs adapt to the desktop: `kdialog` (KDE) → `zenity` (GNOME) → `whiptail` (terminal) → plain prompts. Set `NITROCTL_UI` to force one, `NITROCTL_YES=1` for non-interactive mode.

Notes:

* **Headers follow the running kernel.** On Arch flavours the installer maps `uname -r` to the right `-headers` package (`linux-cachyos-headers`, `linux-zen-headers`, …). On Debian/Ubuntu it uses `linux-headers-$(uname -r)`; on Fedora/RHEL, `kernel-devel`.
* **LLVM only when needed.** The Clang toolchain is installed only if the running kernel was built with Clang (`CONFIG_CC_IS_CLANG=y`) and `clang` is missing.
* **Alpine** uses `doas` instead of `sudo` and OpenRC instead of systemd — the driver's systemd unit does not apply there; load the module via `/etc/modules` or `modprobe` after boot.
* **Gentoo** assumes your kernel sources are already configured; headers come from them.
* **App grid entry.** The installer writes `~/.local/share/applications/nitroctl.desktop` with an absolute `Exec=` path (`~/.local/bin` is often missing from the graphical launcher's PATH on Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora/openSUSE) plus an hicolor SVG icon, and refreshes the desktop/icon caches when the tools exist (`update-desktop-database`, `gtk-update-icon-cache`). No root needed; works on GNOME, KDE, Xfce, Sway and others following freedesktop.org conventions.

## Prerequisites

This tool depends on python and the [Linuwu-Sense](https://github.com/0x7375646F/Linuwu-Sense) module. The setup script installs and registers it via DKMS automatically; the manual guide below is only for special cases.

The graphical interface (`nitroctl-gui`) is a native GTK4 + Libadwaita app and uses the system Python with PyGObject — no virtualenv, no extra downloads. Install the bindings for your distro (the setup script offers to do this — see the table above).

## Installation via setup script

Just run it — it detects your distro, installs dependencies, the app, the GUI bindings and the driver:

```bash
./setup/install.sh
```

When installation finishes, you can run nitroctl from your terminal using:

```bash
nitroctl
```

## Manual installation

First, install Linuwu-Sense the same way its done above. Then, proceed with the installation as described below.

### Step 1: Install dependencies

The required dependencies are python3 and git. Package names may be different on your distro — see the table above for the exact packages per distro.

For Debian:

```bash
sudo apt install python3 git
```

For Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install python3 git
```

For Arch:

```bash
sudo pacman -S python git
```

For Void:

```bash
sudo xbps-install -S python3 git
```

### Step 2: Install nitroctl

Navigate to the destination you want to install nitroctl in your terminal. For example:

```bash
cd ~/your/destination/
```

Then, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eltonacosta/nitroctl.git
```

cd into the cloned repository:

```bash
cd nitroctl
```

Make nitroctl.sh executable:

```bash
chmod +x nitroctl.sh
```

Run nitroctl:

```bash
./nitroctl.sh
```

## Arch Linux (and Arch-based distributions)

Everything above applies to Arch; the setup script picks the `arch` (or `cachyos`) profile automatically. Two details matter on Arch-family systems, especially those that ship Clang-built kernels such as CachyOS:

* **Kernel headers**: installed automatically, flavour-aware (`linux-headers`, `linux-cachyos-headers`, `linux-zen-headers`, … depending on `uname -r`).
* **Clang-built kernels**: Linuwu-Sense does not compile with GCC on those kernels (the kernel itself was built with Clang, and GCC rejects its flags). The installer detects this and builds with `LLVM=1` through DKMS.

The setup script registers Linuwu-Sense with DKMS (`setup/dkms.conf`), applying the Clang compatibility fix (`strncpy` → `memcpy`) at install time. From then on, every kernel update rebuilds and reinstalls the module automatically — no manual recompilation.

## Graphical interface

`nitroctl-gui` offers the same functions as the text menu in a native GTK4 window:

```bash
nitroctl-gui
```

It runs without asking for a password: the installer adds a udev rule (`setup/99-nitroctl.rules`) that gives your user ownership of the driver's sysfs controls, and udev re-applies it on every module load (boot, kernel update, `modprobe`). The password is requested only once, during installation.

On systems without udev the rule cannot be installed; in that case the GUI falls back to elevating itself with `pkexec` (graphical prompt) or `sudo` (terminal fallback), and opening it without privileges still shows the driver state read-only.

Both interfaces share the same driver code (`main/nitro_core.py`), so features and validation rules stay in one place.
